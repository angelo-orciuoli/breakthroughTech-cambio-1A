# mock_query.py ; this is soley a mock query that we can discuss whether or not needs adjusting and that we may use and modify to fit our goal once we have the documents to query 
# loading documents into the code
documents = ["Grant A deadline is June 1", "Grant B focuses on AI research"]

# "index building"
index = {i: doc for i, doc in enumerate(documents)}

# "query system"
def query_engine(question):
    if "deadline" in question.lower():
        return "Grant A deadline is June 1."
    elif "focus" in question.lower() or "topic" in question.lower():
        return "Grant B focuses on AI research."
    else:
        return "I couldn't find that in the documents."

# Ask a question regarding the docs provided 
question = "What is the deadline?"
answer = query_engine(question)

print("Question:", question)
