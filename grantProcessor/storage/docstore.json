Why now? (200-350 words)\u00a0\n\nPlease use 350 words or less\n\nCambio Labs was founded to tackle a dual crisis: exclusion from both education and the economy. Our mission is to create innovative, accessible, and culturally relevant learning pathways into high-growth industries like green energy, technology, and entrepreneurship. While our programs have demonstrated strong impact, we\u2019ve now reached a critical inflection point\u2014demand for our services far exceeds our current capacity, and we need to invest in our platform to make our programming more accessible and responsive.\n\nSince launching in 2021, we\u2019ve supported over 600 learners, but our reach is limited by the constraints of direct service delivery. For example, our Startup NYCHA program received triple the number of applications we could accept. Demand continues to grow as schools, workforce agencies, and public infrastructure partners across New York City and beyond request our programming. To meet this need, we must evolve into a digital-first organization capable of delivering scalable, tech-enabled education.\n\nNow is the time to fully activate and enhance our Journey platform. By integrating generative AI, real-time analytics, and AWS cloud services, we can shift from a locally delivered model to a national, self-paced learning solution. This expansion is especially urgent for learners navigating barriers like economic hardship, limited internet access, or nontraditional work and family schedules.\n\nThis project is not only timely - it\u2019s imperative. As the future of work becomes increasingly digital, underserved communities risk being further marginalized without access to responsive, relevant, and tech-enabled education.

Describe other relevant stakeholders, implementation partners, or other sources of funding that may be involved in contributing to this project\u2019s success.\u00a0\n\nPlease use 250 words or less\n\nCambio Labs will sustain this project long-term through a diversified revenue model and strategic partnerships. Unlike many nonprofits, only 25% of our income comes from grants; the remaining 75% is generated through program and platform revenue. Our Platform-as-a-Product (PaaP) model enables nonprofit, government, and workforce development organizations to license the Journey platform for their own training and education programs. We are actively expanding this model in 2025, with projected platform revenue expected to exceed $1.9M by 2026.\n\nWe are also growing our train-the-trainer model, which empowers institutional partners to deliver our curricula independently, reducing delivery costs while expanding reach. This approach strengthens long-term sustainability by decreasing staffing overhead and increasing scalability.\n\nOur stakeholder ecosystem includes implementation partners such as NYCHA, public libraries, and city workforce agencies, who are eager to integrate Journey-powered training in clean energy, coding, and entrepreneurship. We are also exploring licensing partnerships with HR departments and workforce providers seeking custom, scalable upskilling solutions.\n\nPhilanthropic support plays a complementary but important role. Past and current funders include the TD Charitable Foundation, the Social Justice Accelerator, and Amazon, which supported the initial development of Journey. Additionally, Cambio Labs is securing philanthropic support from aligned funders in the fields of education, climate justice, and workforce equity. \n\nPowered by AWS infrastructure, Journey will benefit from enhanced reliability, data management, and scalability\u2014ensuring this project\u2019s long-term impact is both technically and financially viable.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5372, "end_char_idx": 10539, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cd299da-0d64-448b-b43a-bdf445468826": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cd299da-0d64-448b-b43a-bdf445468826", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/breakthroughTech-cambio-1A/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "355e31f4-4cfe-4231-9d8f-82fbf691328b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/breakthroughTech-cambio-1A/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-19"}, "hash": "d9f5af0b151648ed2a3c19679fe096c7b7a6f578e4e68c6aad1055f1c91f66cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89aca2e9-aee1-4f7e-810b-e4db4580bf1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/breakthroughTech-cambio-1A/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-19"}, "hash": "8c682b8acb2d00953575e887f8273228e51acf250318a72a9a3e544591915289", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3.2 Describe the resources and technical skills you may need to complete the project successfully:\n\nCambio Labs has a strong in-house technical foundation to support the next phase of Journey\u2019s development.
