Why now? (200-350 words)\u00a0\n\nPlease use 350 words or less\n\nCambio Labs was founded to tackle a dual crisis: exclusion from both education and the economy. Our mission is to create innovative, accessible, and culturally relevant learning pathways into high-growth industries like green energy, technology, and entrepreneurship. While our programs have demonstrated strong impact, we\u2019ve now reached a critical inflection point\u2014demand for our services far exceeds our current capacity, and we need to invest in our platform to make our programming more accessible and responsive.\n\nSince launching in 2021, we\u2019ve supported over 600 learners, but our reach is limited by the constraints of direct service delivery. For example, our Startup NYCHA program received triple the number of applications we could accept. Demand continues to grow as schools, workforce agencies, and public infrastructure partners across New York City and beyond request our programming. To meet this need, we must evolve into a digital-first organization capable of delivering scalable, tech-enabled education.\n\nNow is the time to fully activate and enhance our Journey platform. By integrating generative AI, real-time analytics, and AWS cloud services, we can shift from a locally delivered model to a national, self-paced learning solution. This expansion is especially urgent for learners navigating barriers like economic hardship, limited internet access, or nontraditional work and family schedules.\n\nThis project is not only timely - it\u2019s imperative. As the future of work becomes increasingly digital, underserved communities risk being further marginalized without access to responsive, relevant, and tech-enabled education. With this investment, we can seize a transformational opportunity: to scale a proven model, deliver equitable access to career-building education, and create a new national standard for community-driven innovation in workforce development.\n\n\n\n2.7 What most closely aligns with what this project will enable your organization to do?\u00a0\n\nMigrate legacy IT systems and data centers to the cloud\n\nincreased productivity with modernized tools, applications and databases\n\nIncrease cost efficiency with optimized IT structure\n\nEnable business continuity with archive, backup and disaster recovery\n\nIncrease resilience, scaling and availability of existing workloads and databases\n\nIncrease security and governance of data/ensure data compliance (HIPAA/SOC)\n\nInform better decision-making by aggregating disparate data sources and applying analytics (ie visualization, AI, ML)\n\nEnable accurate forecasting based on past data with predictive analysis using machine learning\n\nbetter understand and engage member/donors/beneficiaries by creating a 360 view with constituent data\n\nenhance digital content delivery for member/donors/beneficiaries or other stakeholders (web/mobile app)\n\nenable multichannel services for constituents and automate simple, clerical tasks for employees (chatbots GenAI enabled)\n\nPersonalize and streamline communications for more effective member/donors/beneficiaries engagement and fundraising\n\n\n\n2.8 How will you support this project long-term? Describe other relevant stakeholders, implementation partners, or other sources of funding that may be involved in contributing to this project\u2019s success.\u00a0\n\nPlease use 250 words or less\n\nCambio Labs will sustain this project long-term through a diversified revenue model and strategic partnerships. Unlike many nonprofits, only 25% of our income comes from grants; the remaining 75% is generated through program and platform revenue. Our Platform-as-a-Product (PaaP) model enables nonprofit, government, and workforce development organizations to license the Journey platform for their own training and education programs. We are actively expanding this model in 2025, with projected platform revenue expected to exceed $1.9M by 2026.\n\nWe are also growing our train-the-trainer model, which empowers institutional partners to deliver our curricula independently, reducing delivery costs while expanding reach. This approach strengthens long-term sustainability by decreasing staffing overhead and increasing scalability.\n\nOur stakeholder ecosystem includes implementation partners such as NYCHA, public libraries, and city workforce agencies, who are eager to integrate Journey-powered training in clean energy, coding, and entrepreneurship. We are also exploring licensing partnerships with HR departments and workforce providers seeking custom, scalable upskilling solutions.\n\nPhilanthropic support plays a complementary but important role. Past and current funders include the TD Charitable Foundation, the Social Justice Accelerator, and Amazon, which supported the initial development of Journey. Additionally, Cambio Labs is securing philanthropic support from aligned funders in the fields of education, climate justice, and workforce equity. \n\nPowered by AWS infrastructure, Journey will benefit from enhanced reliability, data management, and scalability\u2014ensuring this project\u2019s long-term impact is both technically and financially viable.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5372, "end_char_idx": 10539, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f42ae28f-4fe5-4f27-8a5d-d11588fb32b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f42ae28f-4fe5-4f27-8a5d-d11588fb32b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49b24901-5c6b-40ed-8991-9434592e3cc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-07"}, "hash": "9e1febcd29268dc8f25f4ca13b744938fd34ac56e81bebf20fd734ba8d6b2530", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5fa3642-828d-4a0f-9a54-6766c1b7c4ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - AWS Grant Proposal rev.Agenor.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 200926, "creation_date": "2025-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-09-07"}, "hash": "e63d9c6372331ce541ee3199c1c85afbd323aa219713d58eba7858549500345b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3.2 Describe the resources and technical skills you may need to complete the project successfully:\n\nCambio Labs has a strong in-house technical foundation to support the next phase of Journey\u2019s development.

This external partnership complements the expertise within our team and strengthens our ability to stay at the forefront of AI and educational technology innovations.\n\nThrough this blend of in-house expertise and strategic external partnerships, we are well-equipped to meet the technical demands of this project.\n\n\n\nEthics and bias. Are there any significant ethical or bias related concerns with the use of these technologies in your project, and if so, how do you expect to approach or mitigate those concerns? See more here. \n\nWhile our project aims to promote equitable access to education and career opportunities, we recognize potential ethical or bias-related concerns with the use of AI technologies. \n\nTo mitigate these concerns, we will:\n\nEnsure our AI models are trained on diverse datasets to minimize bias. Our curricular development team aspires to highlight the entrepreneurial narratives, successes and strategies of diverse entrepreneurs. We also train our AI models on liberatory and community-centered design, a foundational piece of our curriculum.\n\nRegularly audit our algorithms for fairness and accuracy. We also ensure learners in our program learn to engage critically with AI-generated content\n\nImplement transparent data practices, obtaining informed consent from users and adhering to data privacy regulations like GDPR and COPPA. We have developed AI internal and external policies in consultation with pro-bono lawyers through our partnership with We the Action\n\nEngage with community stakeholders and platform users throughout the design process to incorporate feedback and address any ethical concerns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4782, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c65b884a-4cec-41b2-a361-e1a852a35157": {"__data__": {"id_": "c65b884a-4cec-41b2-a361-e1a852a35157", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - TTTR Project -  Platform Content.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - TTTR Project -  Platform Content.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 8132, "creation_date": "2025-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df92b084-5f00-4ab2-88a7-4f7cd52d3a0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "DATA - TTTR Project -  Platform Content.docx", "file_path": "/Users/lanika/Downloads/grantProcessor/applications/DATA - TTTR Project -  Platform Content.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 8132, "creation_date": "2025-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2025-08-29"}, "hash": "75580d854d90042b4475cb737fef3d5bb6b0c55f88489a26f8645709a7e9d271", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Problem statement * 488 / 500\n\n\n\nInequitable and outdated education systems worldwide are not preparing young people for a 21st century world or workforce. Underemployed adults struggle to find jobs, generate enough income to feed their families, and receive the training or capital to start their own businesses.\n\n\n\nWe believe that every human deserves access to quality education and economic opportunity, and that universal access to education can only be achieved at scale through the deployment of technology and AI.\n\n\n\nSolution objectives and milestones * 1998 / 2000\n\n\n\n\n\nCambio Labs built Journey, a gamified learning platform, to make learning engaging and fun for students, and repeatable and scalable for instructors and administrators. In order to revolutionize the usability and scalability of our Journey platform, our team is now developing and piloting Sparky: an AI bot that can personalize and credentialize learning for students at scale, and that can assist teachers and program administrators with curricular development, instructional coaching, assessment, and reporting.\n\n \n\nThe creation and implementation of Sparky AI will improve the effectiveness of our Journey platform and unlock the following capabilities:\n\n\n\n- Enable more self-paced and asynchronous learning, allowing for users to learn independently during non-traditional hours and in non-traditional spaces\n\n- Enable personalized learning and coaching by pulling from user-generated submission data\n\n- Enable easy lesson planning, auto-assessment, skills-tracking, auto-certifications, and auto-reporting - reducing major administrative burdens for overworked teachers\n\n-Enable expert and personalized coaching for course creators that want to use Journey to deliver courses in their own communities \n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to launch the first iteration of Sparky and to test it among our growing, global population of Journey users.\n\n\n\nShorter term project goals include:\n\n- Technical functionality of Sparky bot\n\n- Positive data on satisfaction with Sparky and recommendation to others\n\n- Collect qualitative evidence of personalized learner and instructor support\n\n- Successful program completion, certification, and income generation across courses\n\n\n\nLonger term project goals include:\n\n- Recruiting more technical staff to maintain and develop Sparky\n\n- Creating a mobile responsive version of Journey and Sparky\n\n- Delivering access to Journey and AI to the most remote and marginalized communities\n\n- Universal access to education through cross-sectoral collaboration and new tech infrastructure", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2597, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
