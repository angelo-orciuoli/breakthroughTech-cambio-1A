# Aug 21 Meeting Notes

## Main Points / Takeaways
- **Project Focus:** Build an **AI agent for grant applications**.  
  1. **Grant Discovery:** Research and identify relevant grants.  
  2. **Grant Writing:** Use Cambio Labs data + past applications as context.  
  3. **Output Delivery:** Determine best format for draft applications (e.g., docs, email).  

- **Work Approach:**  
  - First step = research and planning (not coding yet).  
  - Deliverables centralized in the new GitHub repo.  
  - Final presentation in early December.  
- **Meetings:** Bi-weekly; scheduling confirmed via Discord poll.  

## Action Items
1. **All Team Members**  
   - Research methods for grant-finding AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).  
   - Draft a **technical outline** (tools, frameworks, workflow).  
   - Push findings to the repo.  

2. **Next Meeting Goal**  
   - Deliver a clear technical plan for the **grant discovery agent**
